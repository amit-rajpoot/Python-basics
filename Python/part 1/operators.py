# Theory 
'''
1. Arithmetic Operators

Used for mathematical operations:

+ : Addition (a + b)
- : Subtraction (a - b)
* : Multiplication (a * b)
/ : Division (a / b)
% : Modulus (a % b)
** : Exponentiation (a ** b)
// : Floor Division (a // b)

2. Comparison (Relational) Operators

Used to compare two values:

== : Equal to (a == b)
!= : Not equal to (a != b)
> : Greater than (a > b)
< : Less than (a < b)
>= : Greater than or equal to (a >= b)
<= : Less than or equal to (a <= b)

3. Logical Operators

Used to combine conditional statements:
 
and : Logical AND (a and b)
or : Logical OR (a or b)
not : Logical NOT (not a)

4. Bitwise Operators

Operate on binary numbers:

& : AND (a & b)
| : OR (a | b)
^ : XOR (a ^ b)
~ : NOT (~a)
<< : Left Shift (a << b)
>> : Right Shift (a >> b)

5. Assignment Operators

Used to assign values to variables:

= : Assign (a = b)
+= : Add and assign (a += b)
-= : Subtract and assign (a -= b)
*= : Multiply and assign (a *= b)
/= : Divide and assign (a /= b)
%= : Modulus and assign (a %= b)
**= : Exponentiation and assign (a **= b)
//= : Floor division and assign (a //= b)
